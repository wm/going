## going

This repo contains some of the interesting parts I found while doing [tour.golang.com](http://tour.golang.org/#1).

### Files

[exericses.tour.go](exercises.tour.go) was a gist I found to compare my answers too. I have only
looked that the file and I ahve not attenpted to run or validate it.

The numbered files show off some of the features of go.

Note: Files starting with _ are not very instructive on their own but may be helpful when following the tour.


### Resources

The first two are very imformative and a good read. The third is just a reference.
